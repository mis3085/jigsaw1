That's 2.5 times that of an average acute inpatient. Financially, treating PU sets families back by USD 15,700 to USD 17,700. Since 87% are elderly patients, an ageing population and COVID-19 accelerates PU prevalence, exhausting global human, material, and capital reserves.\nReducing pressure injuries for long-term care \u2014 Increasing skin activity and improving blood circulation with alternating pressure.\nProned and intubated COVID-19 patients undergo prone treatments for an average of 5 hospital days. However, as proning results in a higher risk of developing pressure injuries (PI), these patients may require 3 more hospital days to treat PI-related complications,3,4 reducing the nurse-to-patient ratio further.5",

        "description": "On average, 65 per 1000 adult inpatients develop pressure injuries (also known as pressure ulcers) and require 18 in-hospital days. That's 2.5 times that of an average acute inpatient. Financially, treating PU sets families back by USD 15,700 to USD 17,700. Since 87% are elderly patients, an ageing population and COVID-19 accelerates PU prevalence, exhausting global human, material, and capital reserves.\nDomus 3 combines alternating pressure redistribution and static therapy modes for improving pressure relief care and reducing the caregiver's workload during patient handling procedures, such as dressing changes and repositioning. The weight indicator dial on the pump interface allows quick and easy adjustment to match the support surface pressure firmness to the patient's weight distribution.\nOptima Prone's head-to-toe pressure alternation, mechanical apparatus for assisting single-caregiver head repositioning, personalized pressure care with individual air cell deflation, and a unique facial pillow with sculpted ear pocket reduces caregiver workload and risks of pressure injuries, improving patient outcomes.",

Preventing pressure injuries improves patient outcomes and patient care experience.\nDomus 3 combines alternating pressure redistribution and static therapy modes for improving pressure relief care and reducing the caregiver's workload during patient handling procedures, such as dressing changes and repositioning. The weight indicator dial on the pump interface allows quick and easy adjustment to match the support surface pressure firmness to the patient's weight distribution.",
