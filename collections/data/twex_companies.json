What’s more, it further focuses its global mission by ushering in globalized fashion elements and by giving new life to ceramic works, making them measurable not only in terms of quantity and prices but also with their artistic values.","showroom":null,"video_title":null,"video_url":null,"video_thumbnail":null}]},{"sequence":4447,"id":"93cb671b-80d4-487e-bc11-da3c13d3006c","created_at":"2021-06-30 09:56:14","updated_at":"2021-12-08 08:53:10","deleted_at":null,"sort":326,"site_id":0,"enabled":1,"approved":"approved","slug":"52634602","logo":"imports\/logos\/52634602.jpg","tel":"04-24063766","fax":"04-24065612","email":"info_cec@charder.com.tw","website":"https:\/\/www.chardermedical.com\/","contacts":{"0":{"person":"陳韋彤","person_title":"行銷企劃","email":"steven_chen@charder.com.tw","tel":"04-24063766 #283","fax":"04-24065612"},"new_1":{"person":"卓曉彤","person_title":"行銷處長","email":"info_cec@charder.com.tw","tel":"04-24063766 #280","fax":"04-24065612"}},"translations":[{"sequence":8883,"id":"93cb671b-8124-48c0-b6b9-8b9ba3e2ff5d","company_id":"93cb671b-80d4-487e-bc11-da3c13d3006c","locale":"zh_TW","name":"啟德電子股份有限公司","description":"啟德電子成立於1980年，以測量起家，並致力於設計品質優良的度量衡設備。創立至今，在台深耕，一路從電路板代工到生產家用體重計，發展至專業醫療秤重領域，近年來更努力朝向健身市場發展。\n\n2005年成立自有品牌「啟德醫療」Charder Medical跨足歐盟醫療體系市場，於2008年成立家用健康管理品牌「歐瑟若」oserio，主打一般家用消費市場，在行銷推廣的過程中，利用專業醫療的品牌形象與設備型的產品質量，來加強消費型產品線客戶的信心；同時，透過消費型產品來廣泛地接觸專業醫療潛在客戶，讓同時有在兩個市場領域都有經營的各國經銷商，能夠藉由消費型產品認識專業醫療產品線，形成相輔相成的品牌效益。\n\n啟德憑藉著多年來，與超過40個國家客戶的合作經驗，以及高度的垂直整合能力，提供客戶從產品發想概念，到完成生產發貨的一站式服務。\n\n在台灣，啟德是首家榮獲「工研院科技體適能產品認證標章」的國內製造商。除了「台灣GMP認證」外，也擁有「歐盟CE MDD認證」，產品符合OIML規範，品質系統通過ISO 13485、ISO 9001品質管理系統認證，為符合歐盟高規格要求的優良工廠。","meta_title":"啟德電子股份有限公司","meta_description":"啟德電子股份有限公司成立於1980年，主要的營業項目為研發設計、製造電子秤，並於2005年起以自有品牌「啟德醫療」Charder Medical跨足歐盟醫療體系市場，近20年來更從電子度量衡領域進一步拓展至身體組成分析測量，推出一系列人體組成分析儀。\r\n啟德憑藉著多年來與超過40個國家的客戶合作經驗，以及高度的垂直整合能力，提供客戶從產品發想概念到完成生產發貨的一站式服務。\r\n本公司製造工廠獲得GMP合格醫材工廠認證，產品符合OIML、CEMDD 規範，公司品質系統通過ISO 13485、ISO 9001品質管理系統認證，為符合歐盟高規格要求的優良工廠。","brand_description":"「啟德醫療」Charder Medical為啟德電子於2005年成立，由OEM\/ODM轉型經營自有品牌的第一步。在此品牌成立之前，啟德已有20年的代工經驗，在電子度量衡領域有著成熟的研發與製造經驗。\n\n2003年歐盟頒布了，所有醫療院所的電子秤產品，必需具備歐盟度量衡法規與醫療器材註冊的門檻。因這個契機，啟德決定成立自有品牌，調整公司的發展策略，朝向有法規、門檻較高規格的醫療領域發展，而非侷限於逐年降利，維持代工營運模式。秉持著與客戶建立良好互動關係的原則下，確認當時的代工客戶皆無經營醫療市場，便成立Charder Medical品牌，目標就是要讓全世界的醫療院所，都能使用台灣品牌的醫療用秤。\n\n品牌創立之初，市場上對於來自台灣的新品牌接受度很低，品牌推廣時，不斷面臨客戶要求，要貼上對方品牌來進行銷售。基於經營品牌的堅持，公司回絕了這些交易，導致品牌成立前5年，展覽行銷費用遠大於實際品牌的營業額。但公司並沒有因此而放棄，透過加強客戶關係並保障經銷代理權益的方式，憑藉著厚實的研發能力，配合各國當地市場不同的需求，以少量多樣的操作模式，漸漸取得經銷客戶的信心。\n\n後來，公司也推出與競爭對手有差異化的獨特商品，切中歐盟高齡社會族群，並重視每一個，個人社福權益的市場需求，一步步開拓市場上的佔有率。\n\n在2008年時，啟德決定成立家用健康管理品牌「歐瑟若」oserio，主打一般家用消費市場，並以「健康管理中心」自許，希望能藉由體重計、體脂計等健康管理產品，將16年製作專業健檢儀器的技術，帶到居家生活中，目的就是為了要讓所有人，在家也能擁有醫療等級規格的設備，讓居家生活更健康、也更安心。\n\n行銷團隊持續關注市場動態，秉持著好還要更好的精神，持續改善產品、新增功能、不斷優化App。從8年前推出第一代App開始，到目前已更新到第三代，除了定期維護更新之外，更不斷進行優化，譬如最近二次的優化項目分別為，新增不同平台登入功能(Apple ID, Google ID, Facebook登入)，及新增資料同步功能(Apple Care, Google Health)。\n\n啟德不管是在「啟德醫療」或是在「歐瑟若」，皆秉持著一本初衷，始終如一的精神，認真看待所有產品。身為台灣在地品牌，我們可以大聲的說，啟德電子就是堅持要給您最好的。","showroom":null,"video_title":null,"video_url":null,"video_thumbnail":null},{"sequence":8884,"id":"93cb671b-81ea-4f73-a5ad-ff5bd49674b0","company_id":"93cb671b-80d4-487e-bc11-da3c13d3006c","locale":"en","name":"CHARDER ELECTRONIC CO., LTD.","description":"Founded in 1980, Charder specializes in designing and manufacturing for the global weighing industry and health management market.

The granting of licenses for the production of this patented screw and rolling die is the even more important task of TENZ International.\n\nIn 2019, the world’s largest DIY chain in the US, decided to equip its own wood screw with TENZ® technology, now available in 2,200 DIY stores across the US.","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"brand_description":"Screws – it’s shape and design is well known over 2000 years, first found by Archimedes of Syracuse. Tenz has reinvented the screw because the energy need is reduced to the minimum. The result: better performance with less effort.\n\nThe way the technology works was brought closer by imagining a dancing movement in wood. From the \"dancing screw\" the name was derived: TENZ.\n\nTENZ® received the Red Dot Award: Product Design 2019, one among several awards TENZ® has won over these years. The screw was successfully tested for its back-friendliness and has become the only screw in the world with AGR seal (Healthy Back Campaign), therefore recommended by German doctors and therapists.\n\nThe motivation behind the brand TENZ® is to sharpen people’s perception of the supposedly unimportant everyday utensils. Using the example of the screw, the goal is to show that all of us in the community can achieve global savings in energy consumption through the smallest changes in the swarm.","showroom":null,"video_title":null,"video_url":null,"video_thumbnail":null}]},{"sequence":4477,"id":"93cb671e-ced5-4110-afc9-ff2c0a0ead0e","created_at":"2021-06-30 09:56:17","updated_at":"2021-10-21 15:16:55","deleted_at":null,"sort":274,"site_id":0,"enabled":1,"approved":"approved","slug":"52353530","logo":"imports\/logos\/52353530.jpg","tel":"04-24636000","fax":"04-24639600","email":"info@goodwaycnc.com","website":"https:\/\/www.goowaycnc.com","contacts":[{"person":"楊德華","person_title":"董事長","tel":"04-3591226#255"},{"person":"吳江松","person_title":"經理","email":"1031@goodwaycnc.com","tel":"04-24636000#12262","fax":"04-24635200"},{"person":"王丞軒","person_title":"經理","email":"1062@goodwaycnc.com","tel":"04-24629698#62351","fax":"04-24628002"},{"person":"謝秀芬","person_title":"副總經理","email":"rebecca@goodwaycnc.com"}],"translations":[{"sequence":8943,"id":"93cb671e-cf3e-4ec1-b517-ae1e4309081a","company_id":"93cb671e-ced5-4110-afc9-ff2c0a0ead0e","locale":"zh_TW","name":"程泰機械股份有限公司","description":"48年來，程泰機械始終專注於CNC車床的研發與生產，並以自有品牌GOODWAY行銷全球50個國家或地區，產品線涵蓋多軸、立式、臥式、走心式等各型車床。\r\n近年來，高精密外圓磨床及中心孔磨床加入產品陣容。全方位的車、銑、磨加工對策。讓航太、汽車、能源、電子、通訊等各個專業製造領域，都能見到GOODWAY工具機協助生產製造的蹤跡。","meta_title":"程泰機械股份有限公司","meta_description":"45年來，程泰機械始終專注於CNC車床的研發與生產，並以自有品牌GOODWAY 行銷全球 55 個國家或地區，產品線涵蓋多軸、立式、臥式、走心式等各型車床。\r\n近年來，高精密外圓磨床及中心孔磨床加入產品陣容。全方位的車、銑、磨加工對策。讓航太、汽車、能源、電子、通訊等各個專業製造領域，都能見到 GOODWAY 工具機協助生產製造的蹤跡。","brand_description":"程泰機械成立於 1975 年，為目前台灣地區最具規模的專業 CNC 車床製造廠商之一，擁有超過四十年生產高品質、高精密、高性能 CNC 車床的經驗。近年來，更建立了具備動力刀塔、副主軸、雙主軸 \/ 雙刀塔、Y 軸、B 軸等機構以及立式與走心式的 CNC 車床生產線，以滿足廣大客戶多樣化的需求。\r\n目前，每年有超過 1,500 台從程泰出廠的 CNC 車床，出口至全世界超過 45 個國家或地區，並以 20% 以上的出貨年增率持續而穩定的成長。","showroom":"https:\/\/www.goodwaycnc.com\/showroom\/tw.html","video_title":null,"video_url":null,"video_thumbnail":null},{"sequence":8944,"id":"93cb671e-cfa4-4cee-84e9-1152c369c93b","company_id":"93cb671e-ced5-4110-afc9-ff2c0a0ead0e","locale":"en","name":"Goodway Machine Corp.","description":"For 45 years, Goodway has been dedicated to the production and development of CNC lathe and has been selling over 55 countries globally with its own brand.

In 2000, Jing-Fong established the first overseas manufacturing plant in Thailand to implement the strategies of global localization production and International Division of Labor. Through strategic alliance with Germany auto companies, we successfully introduced lock nuts to the supply chain of new car assembly as Tier-1 supplier, including Mercedes Benz, BMW and other global auto manufacturers. The overall margin profit also showed a leap-forward growth. At present, Jing-Fong is the largest supplier of lock nuts in Daimler AG's global assembly plant, and the main supplier of key fasteners for various ZF SACHS vehicle shock absorbers.","showroom":null,"video_title":null,"video_url":null,"video_thumbnail":null}]},{"sequence":4529,"id":"93cb6724-5f2e-410b-bed9-6e8e4118178d","created_at":"2021-06-30 09:56:20","updated_at":"2021-09-30 14:27:40","deleted_at":null,"sort":360,"site_id":0,"enabled":1,"approved":"approved","slug":"97405082","logo":"images\/logos\/21092811\/603b1e40df65874d7e4af54ab57d003e.jpg","tel":"04-7373668","fax":"04-7371618","email":"sales@trimmer.com.tw","website":"http:\/\/www.trimmer.com.tw\/","contacts":{"0":{"person":"蔡文彰","person_title":"國外業務","email":"tsai@trimmer.com.tw","tel":"04-7373668#250","fax":"04-7371618"},"1":{"person":"陳香瑜","person_title":"業務人員","email":"vicky@trimmer.com.tw","tel":"04-7373668#227","fax":"04-7371618"},"2":{"person":"姚倍欽","person_title":"負責人","email":"sales@trimmer.com.tw","tel":"04-7373668","fax":"04-7371618"},"new_1":[]},"translations":[{"sequence":9047,"id":"93cb6724-5fbb-4b53-a3a3-dc9257974f7e","company_id":"93cb6724-5f2e-410b-bed9-6e8e4118178d","locale":"zh_TW","name":"臻禾興業有限公司","description":"臻禾興業有限公司，是一個擁有多年經驗及專業技術的農業機械工具製造商。除了提供高品質的電動割草機、花園籬芭剪、挖孔機、引擎式割草機、背負式噴霧機、背負式割草機和複合式工具，另外，我們還提供園林綠化設備，如: 鬆土機、高空鍊鋸機和園藝機械零配件。","meta_title":"臻禾興業有限公司","meta_description":"臻禾興業有限公司，是一個擁有多年經驗及專業技術的農業機械工具製造商。除了提供高品質的電動割草機、花園籬芭剪、挖孔機、引擎式割草機、背負式噴霧機、背負式割草機和複合式工具，另外，我們還提供園林綠化設備，如: 鬆土機、高空鍊鋸機和園藝機械零配件。","brand_description":"我司成立於1997年, 由農機零件供應商成功轉型為割草機製造商, 並成為多家世界知名品的代工廠. 於2006年推出自有品牌MORI(魔力), 將MIT精神成功推向另一個巔峰.\r\nMORI源自日文”森”,以崇尚大自然, 瞭解森林芬多精能降低空氣塵蟎、減輕呼吸系統的負擔,欣賞森林景致,能改善心情提振精神.\r\nMORI除了專業級割草機, 也有一般民眾使用的機種，除了效率提昇, 也降低長時間使用所產生的勞累. 簡易操作以及人體工學的輕量設計, 即使是女性及年長者, 也能輕易使用MORI的園藝機具.\r\n近期地球暖化日益嚴重, 造成極端氣候. 有鑒於此, MORI於2010年開始,將累積近20年的經驗做第二次技術轉型.\r\n首先開發零污染的電動園藝工具, 於2012年推出第一款電動割草機, 並於隔年取得歐洲(CE)認證及日本電氣安規(PSE)認證, 2014年持續研發出電動複合式鍊鋸,籬笆剪等產品。2018年推出電動無刷馬達割草機及背負式大電池包,進而提升效能和延長操作使用時間,2019年推出電動棕油機，針對東南亞棕梠油園丘主，對以綠能採收棕油果實的重視。\r\n我司持續不斷參與國內外各大展覽,積極推廣環保動力, 深受客戶廣大的回響.鼓舞我們持續開發更有效率的電動園藝工具, 力行環保愛地球, 為後代子孫保留乾淨的生活環境.","showroom":null,"video_title":"【特別企劃】拜訪台灣在地農機公司，解密台灣本土品牌割草機的誕生","video_url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=G-cdcTZI1Ec&t=262s","video_thumbnail":"images\/thumbnails\/21092811\/1bf4709dabe10559ca188b5b6334cf05.jpg"},{"sequence":9048,"id":"93cb6724-601e-4d13-9a78-8e2018cb1d3f","company_id":"93cb6724-5f2e-410b-bed9-6e8e4118178d","locale":"en","name":"Jyen Herr Enterprise Co., Ltd.","description":"Jyen Herr Enterprise Co., Ltd. is an outstanding wholesale Manufacturer, Supplier and Exporter of Lawn Mower, Grass Trimmer, Brush Cutter , Garden Tiller, Garden Auger, Garden Pruner, Garden Sprayer, Garden Hedge Trimmer, with a factory in Taiwan.\r\n\r\nWe supply and export consistently high quality Garden Machine.
